        <h1>About The App</h1>
        <br>
        <p id="descreption">This app helps you stay in good health. It is very easy to use and anyone can learn how to use it. The BMI calculator is the first health test you can do. It gives an accurate BMI and it saves time calculating it yourself. Water Consumption is also an important part of being healthy and this app will help you track just that. It helps you calculate heart rate and find WHR easily. I have spent a lot of time making it and hope you like the app. Thank You.</p>
